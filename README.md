3. Receive an overall PMF score out of 100
4. Share your scorecard or use stealth mode to hide your idea

## Privacy & Data

**Your ideas are never stored.** There is no database. When you submit an idea:

- It goes directly to Anthropic's Claude API for analysis
- The response is sent back to your browser
- Nothing is saved on our servers
- Once you close the tab, the idea is gone

We use Google Analytics for basic usage tracking (page views, not your ideas).
